# Exploit Development Attempts Archive

This folder contains all the attempts made while developing the working SEED Labs exploit.

## Journey Overview

These files represent the debugging process to solve:
1. GDB vs runtime address differences
2. EDX register pollution issues
3. Shellcode placement strategies
4. NOP sled optimization

## Files (chronological order):

- `seedlabs_exploit_v2.py` - Early attempt with basic shellcode
- `seedlabs_exploit_v4.py` - Testing offset calculations
- `seedlabs_exploit_working.py` - Attempted payload structure
- `seedlabs_exploit_final.py` - Pwntools-based approach
- `seedlabs_exploit_env.py` - Environment variable method attempt
- `seedlabs_final_attempt.py` - Address adjustment testing
- `seedlabs_simple.py` - Simplified payload test
- `seedlabs_exploit_clean.py` - Pre-EDX fix version (closest to working)

## Final Working Solution

The working exploit is in: `../lab3-seedlabs/exploit.py`

Key breakthrough: Adding `xor edx, edx` instruction to clear register before execve syscall.
